Supplementary Data for the Article "The MDD concept for establishing trust in non-significant results - a critical review"

This repository provides all R code for Mair et al. (2020) **"The MDD concept for establishing trust in non-significant results - a critical review"**. 

The material is organized in two folders:

* [**Publication**](https://github.com/TheoreticalEcology/Mair-et-al-2020/tree/master/Publication): 

  Subfolder 'Code' contains the materials necessary to reproduce all simulations and analyses in Mair et al. (2020):
  + Simulation 1 belongs to the section "Can the MDD discriminate between true and false negative tests?"
  + Simulation 2 belongs to the section "Sensitivity of the MDD and other statistical filters to real effect size"

  Subfolder 'SupplementalData' contains the Supplemental Data file published along with the article. 
  The file 'MDD.R' contains the function used to calculate the minimum detectable difference (MDD) for the t-test

* [**MDDshiny**](https://github.com/Mair-et-al-2020/Mair-et-al-2020/tree/master/MDDshiny): This contains a Shiny application reproducing the experimental simulations (1 and 2), allows to specify experimental statistical parameters, and produces figures similar to figures 5-7 in the article.
